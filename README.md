# world-gen
An experiment about procedurally generating a fantasy world, a la Dwarf Fortress or Caves of Qud.
The generator is mainly designed not to do anything by itself, but to provide a backdrop for a human-run game like Dungeons and Dragons.

You can pre-define a starting point for the simulation by defining people, places, species (as in humans, elves), etc.

## Running
You should be able to simply use `cargo run`, but read [eframe's docs](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe) beforehand to make sure you have all requirements.
